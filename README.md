# BuidlGuidl Nodes Setup in Nigeria

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance Ethereum's decentralization in Nigeria through the deployment and operation of two BuidlGuidl nodes. The initiative includes hardware procurement, node setup, and the onboarding of local RPC operators to maintain the infrastructure.

## Current Progress
We have successfully initiated the first phase of the project with one node deployment. The second phase, including the setup of an additional node, is pending further funding.

## Hardware Specifications
The current node configuration includes:
- Storage: 2TB NVMe SSD
- Memory: 16GB RAM
- Processor: Intel Core i5

## Project Phases

### 1. Hardware Procurement
- [x] First node hardware acquisition
- [ ] Second node hardware acquisition (pending funding)

### 2. Node Setup and Syncing
- [x] Initial node configuration
- [ ] Second node setup (pending)

### 3. Operator Onboarding
- In progress: Identifying and training local Nigerian operators
- Goal: Two dedicated operators for node maintenance

### 4. Maintenance and Monitoring
- Establishing monitoring systems
- Creating maintenance protocols
- Setting up operator support structure

## Next Steps
- Secure remaining funding for second node
- Complete operator selection process
- Implement monitoring solutions
- Document full setup procedures

## Updates
This document will be updated regularly to reflect project progress and additional implementations.

## Funding Status
- Initial funding received and utilized for first node
- Additional funding required for second node deployment

*Note: This is an active project, and documentation will be expanded as we progress with the implementation.*
